# Data Representation Project 2021
Repository for GMIT Data Representation Project 2021

This repository holds the complete project data and program code for the DR Course Winter 2021.

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to create a web application in Flask using RESTful API's that links to a database table and allows for CRUD operations through a web page. 

I have created a gym class booking application that:
- Displays the list and details of class bookings for a fictitious gym, Gerrys Gym. 
- Allows for bookings to be created and classes and instructors to be selected for each booking. 
- Allows individual bookings to be seleced and any of the details updated.
- Allows for individual bookings to be deleted. 

All of these activities are interfaced to a bookings table on a mySQL database.
